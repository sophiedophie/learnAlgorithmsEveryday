# learnAlgorithmsEveryday

## Everything starts with one small step.
-- Repository for study how to solve problems in JavaScript.

### Rule
* Solve at least one question everyday and commit to the repository
* Think about optimization & efficiency at the same time
* Summarize what I learn, and useful thought from the solution

### In the near future I want to...
* Find colleagues with full of curiosity to solve and study together :)
* Try to solve in Scala as well!
